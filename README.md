## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## How to run in you [linux:bash] / [windows:cmd/pwsh]
### You must have Java Runtime Environment installed in your system

run these bat[windows] or bash[linux] script in this order
- clear [ clears the previous compiled classes ]
- compile [ compiles the "\*.java" files --> "\*.class" files ]
- run  [ starting with this will work; cause the compiled classes are given ]

## you can also run dev.sh to run all 3 at once !!
